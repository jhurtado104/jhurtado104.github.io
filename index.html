						<h2 class="project-titles">Cuphead Clone</h2>
						<span class="image main project-preview">
							<img src="images/cuphead-clone-snapshot.jpg" alt="Cuphead Website Clone Snapshot" />
							<a href="https://cupheadclonedemo.netlify.app/" class="text-on-blurred-bg" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>

						</span>
						<p>
							My idea for the Cuphead Clone website was to get familiar with React and what it has to offer in the front end process. In the 
							process I overcame a few challenges. The most challenging of them was learning to make the website mobile friendly and should be 
							one of the main focuses because you want to take into consideration the amount of people that use devices other than a computer to 
							view websites. I made the website with React so that I can futher implement some of the features that it offers.

					<!-- Project 2 -->
					<div class="section-separator">
						<h2 class="project-titles">Movie Search</h2>
						<span class="image main project-preview">
							<img src="images/movie-search-snapshot.jpg" alt="Movie Search Snapshot" />
							<a class="text-on-blurred-bg disabled">Live Demo</a>
							<a href="https://github.com/jhurtado104/movie-search" class="text-on-blurred-bg source-code-text" target="_blank">Source Code</a>
						</span>
						<p>
							In my Movie Search project, I sought to learn both React and how to use an <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">OMDb</a>
							(Open Movie Database) API to gather information for each movie. This project can be used to show movie titles with the year it was 
							released and if it has a movie poster it will show up in each card, but if it doesn't it will have a placeholder instead. The most 
							challenging part was trying to get familiar with a whole new environment, React. I was challenged to use three features that React 
							provides (useState, useEffect, and useRef). I learned the syntax for JSX and used it to create each movie card.

					<!-- Project 3 -->
					<div class="section-separator last-separator">
						<h2 class="project-titles">Rocket League Wiki</h2>
						<span class="image main project-preview">
							<img src="images/first-project-snapshot.jpg" alt="First Project Snapshot" />
							<a href="https://rocketleaguewikidemo.netlify.app/" class="text-on-blurred-bg" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>
							<a href="https://github.com/jhurtado104/rocket-league-wiki" class="text-on-blurred-bg source-code-text" target="_blank">Source Code</a>
						</span>
						<p>
							This project was the start of my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My idea of for this project was to create a wiki for a game, 
							Rocket League, that I enjoy playing on leisure. The project is ment to explain the core aspect of what makes Rocket League unique from other
							big titles. I learned the complexity and what it takes to design just the front end of a static website. I would have to say that the most 
							challenging part of the project was the Ranks page. Most of my challenges were trying to implement a text box that would have an output for 
							the user that would tell the user what rank they would be in or what there MMR (Match Making Rating) would be in the competitive 3v3 playlist.

					<p>
						Hello, my name is Jose and I am a Software Engineer. I enjoy learning about new technologies and am passionate about expanding my palette of knowledge
						on skills I have not yet mastered. My fundamental passion in technology stemmed from being curious about how video games worked and what the process 
						looked like to make an idea become something out of nothing. A few of my hobbies include going on hikes or walking, puzzles, video games, bowling, 
						listening to music, and watching shows or movies.
